            I am a final-semester master's student of IT automation systems at
            Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. I am characterized by
            strong analytical skills and pay close attention to detail and
            aesthetics. After 1.5 years of experience working as an IT
            administrator, I am now seeking an internship that aligns more
            closely with my interests and passions.
